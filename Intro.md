# 📖 A Story about Markov's Garden 🌱

In a quiet village on the edge of a sprawling forest, there lived a peculiar gardener named Andrey Markov. Unlike other gardeners, who planted their crops in neat, predictable rows, Andrey saw his garden as a living mathematical puzzle, where each plant had its place not just for beauty, but for balance and harmony.

## Markov’s Garden

One misty morning, Andrey stood at the centre of his garden, holding a beetroot seedling in his hands. "You," he whispered to the tiny sprout, "shall be the heart of my Markov Garden." He gently planted it in the soft soil, pondering how to surround it with companions that would nurture and protect it.

To build a Markov Blanket around his beetroot, Andrey carefully selected plants that would support and complement it. He planted onions nearby, their pungent scent helping to repel pests that might otherwise gnaw at the beetroot’s leaves. He knew that onions could sometimes attract alum aphids, but the balance of the garden would help keep them in check.

Next, he chose broccoli, not just because it stood tall and proud, but because it loved calcium-rich soil. The beetroot, by contrast, didn’t mind the lower calcium levels, allowing the two to peacefully coexist without competing for nutrients.

On either side, he placed Brussels sprouts and cabbage, their sturdy stalks forming a protective barrier while their leaves shaded the ground, keeping it cool and moist. To complete the circle, Andrey planted Swiss chard with its colourful stems and lush foliage, holding the soil together and attracting beneficial insects to patrol the garden.

When the planting was done, Andrey stood back and smiled. His beetroot now lay safely within a circle of companions, each plant playing a role in the dynamic Markov Blanket: a living boundary that guarded and supported the beetroot while allowing each plant to thrive in harmony.

Wiping his hands on his coat, Andrey whispered to the garden, "Together, you are more than the sum of your parts." And as the seasons passed, the Markov Garden thrived: balanced, resilient, and harmonious.
